# Question-Answering-System-using-BERT-and-SQUAD
A simple yet accurate Question Answering in python using BERT and SQUAD

STEPS to Use:
1. Enter/Paste a paragraph or passage from where you want to find answers.
2. Ask the Question based on the passage

Limitations:
- Sometimes if the Passage is too huge it might require more internal memory 
- If the Passage is enormous when compared to question it may produce errors
